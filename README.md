# General-Applications
 A list of general apps created using C/C++. These apps range from video game mechanics, simulators, data structures, algorithmns, SFML etc.

Noteable Applications:
======================
| DOTA:
A simplified CTI based version of the video game DOTA. Part playable, part simulation. (GRAPHICS TO BE ADDED). Includes, file streaming to define game properties from a single .txt file.

| Dungeon Crawler:
A procedurally generated dungeon crawler with an inventory system, enemies, pickups, puzzles etc.

| Stock Simulator:
Simulates a set of stocks simutanouesly (Multi-threading included). Allows for the creation and removal of stocks as well as simulating natural disasters, location properties, goverment changes etc. (These events are called at random, rate at which they are called can be changed during runtime).

| Risk of Rain 2:
CTI implementation of the Risk of Rain 2 item system, choose a character to determine base stats and properties, then open chests to see what you get

| Sudoku:
Full Suduko application. Generates puzzles, allows the user to play or run a solver algorithm to get the answer.

| File-Based Person Generator:
Generates a person, credentials and interests. All done exclusively through files.

| TCG (Trading-Card Game):
A SFML based trading card game concept. Draw cards and place them on a grid.

| Data Structures and Algorithms:
Contains raw implementations of a number of data strucutres and algorithms, ranging from Linked-Lists, Binary tree's, binary search etc.

| Recursive Stuff:
A bunch of problems solved exclusively via recursion.
